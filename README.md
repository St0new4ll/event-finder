Release Notes

Milestone 1:
Bare Bones Web Application, which includes a Manager Dashboard that allows a user to add an event or delete it (very basic so it can be improved upon in Milestone 2). 

The HomePage which lists events that have been added in the Manager Dashboard. You cannot delete an event on this page.

The Register page which allows the user to register a guest or manager account. This works, but the backend server has not been installed so the app does not remember the credentials. (Can be improved in Milestone 3)

The Login page which should allow users to login, however, the backend has yet to be installed and can be improved in Milestone 3.

Libraries Installed:
npm install react
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-toastify
npm install axios

To test the code run: 'npm start' in the event-finder folder
